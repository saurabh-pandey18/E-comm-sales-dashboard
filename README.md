🛒 E-Commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI) — Project Overview

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing sales data from an e-commerce business. The main goal of the dashboard is to help understand how the business is performing in terms of revenue, profit, quantity sold, and customer behavior across different regions and categories.

📌 Dashboard Highlights
	•	At the top of the dashboard, you can see four major KPIs:
	•	Total Sales (₹438K): Shows the overall revenue earned.
	•	Total Quantity Sold (5615): Gives an idea of how many items were sold.
	•	Total Profit (₹37K): This tells whether the business is profitable overall.
	•	Average Order Value (₹121K): The average value of each order.
	•	On the left, I’ve added a bar chart that shows state-wise performance. This helps identify the top contributing states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.
	•	The Monthly Profit Chart (top right) clearly displays profit variations across months. For example, we can see losses in May, July, and December — which signals months that might need marketing attention or cost adjustments.
	•	In the center, I included a donut chart of quantity by product category to show which type of products sell the most — Clothing leads here.
	•	Similarly, payment method breakdown shows what modes customers prefer — UPI, COD, Debit, etc.
	•	The Sub-category Profitability chart shows which items are the most profitable — like Printers and Bookcases, while others like Accessories and Tables are contributing less.
	•	Finally, customer-level sales analysis helps spot top buyers so personalized strategies can be planned.
